# tp-auth

This repo has been migrated from the [Mastermind project](https://github.com/alvidir/mastermind).

Due its potential seems appropriate to detach it from any other project and keep it as an independent repository; this means upgrading this utilitie as a brand new `service/package`; being reachable for all this applications that require any kind of authentication management.
